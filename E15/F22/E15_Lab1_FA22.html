**ENGR 015 Lab 1 (Fall 2022): Introduction to Program Flow in Embedded Systems**

# Lab Overview
The goal of this lab is to introduce you to the basics of program flow in embedded systems. You'll review code from two different systems (a Haas Milling Machine and the Adafruit Circuit Playground), predict what you expect the output to be for a set of different programs, and then compare your predictions with the live results from said programs. After gaining some experience reading code, you'll also write your own programs on the Circuit Playground based on the specifications described later in the lab.

By the end of this lab, you should be able to describe how the `setup()` and `loop()` functions work on the Circuit Playground, and write your own programs to set the neopixels (lights) to arbitrary values. Instructions for grading and what to turn in are included in the [Lab Report section](#Lab Report).

# Lab Groups

Lab groups will be added here after registration.

# Understanding Program Flow (Lab Exercises)
For this lab, you will be reviewing code for two different embedded systems (Haas Milling Machine and Circuit Playground). The Haas Milling Machine is a large manufacturing machine located in the Singer basement. As such, lab groups will be rotated through the machine shop in shifts. Please review the Haas machine code before your shift downstairs, and complete the Circuit Playground exercises as you wait if you have a later shift.

## Haas Milling Machine (2 pts)
The Haas Milling Machine in the Singer Basement is a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine. A user can design a part using Computer Assisted Design (CAD) tools like Fusion360, and the machine automatically generates and executes instructions to create the desired part through a process known as subtractive manufacturing (it removes material rather than adding it). Although very different from the small embedded systems we'll be using in the rest of E15, we're including it in lab 1 as it is a good physical example of how programming and embedded systems work in the real world. You can watch the each line of code in real time as the machine mills the part.

### Understanding G-codes


The Haas milling machine uses special codes called G-codes and M-codes to create parts. The code is divided up into three sections: setup/calibration, cutting, and wrapup. For this lab, we'll focus on the cutting part, though I'll include the full code at the end if you are curious. There will be three different programs. Check the [Lab Groups Section](#LabGroups) to see which code you'll be working with.

The relevant code for this lab is the `G01` G-code. This is used to cut a part using linear motion, meaning that the tool that cuts the part moves in a straight line to the specified coordinates. The `G01` code has two components:

- X, Y, Z coordinates to move to
- arc radius (R) or chamfer distance (C)

The arc radius or chamfer distance are used to alter the corners of the part (called a fillet or a chamfer). Applying these to the corner of the piece has a number of advantages: 1) it makes assembly of multiple parts easier, 2) it keeps a user from injuring themselves on a sharp edge and 3) it looks better than a normal edge. Our code examples will apply either a fillet or chamfer to a part.

![Figure [edge]: Example of an edge that is either untouched (left), has a chamfer (middle), or fillet (right). [Image source](https://www.mytworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Edge.Chamfer.Fillet.grey_okajtg.jpg)](images/edge_chamfer_fillet.png)

An example line of G-code might look like this: `G01 Y-1., R0.0500`. This tells the code to move to -1 inches in the Y-axis, while keeping the X and Z axes constant, and with a rounded corner of 0.05 inches. If you see a `G90` after the `G01`, that means that all the following values are absolute positions for the subsequent commands.

For your code example, please determine:

- What you expect the size of the part to be
- The likely starting position of the tool that cuts the part
- What the part might look like after the program has completed

You will verify your answers as you watch the code run live in the shop. Be sure to keep track of your predictions and the results for your lab report.

## Circuit Playground (8 pts)
The Circuit Playground is a small embedded system that you'll be using in lecture. It has 10 colored LEDs called neopixels that can be set to arbitrary different colors, along with sensors and buttons. You'll learn more about these in lecture.

![Figure [playground]: The Adafruit Circuit Playground.](images/circuit_playground_3000_front_lit_ORIG.jpeg)

For this lab, our goal is to learn the basic program flow of the code that runs on the Circuit Playground. We'll use the neopixels as an example to get familiar with the system. The device consists of two functions that we can write code inside of. One is called `setup()`; code inside here is run once. The other is called `loop()`; code inside here is run indefinitely. When writing code for the CircuitPlayground, use the following as a template:

```
#include &lt;Adafruit_CircuitPlayground.h&gt;

void setup(){
	// code can be placed here and will run once
	CircuitPlayground.begin(); // initializes circuit playground functions
}

void loop(){
	// code can be placed here and will be run repeatedly
}
```

All text after a `//` are called comments. These are for humans only and are not interpreted by the Circuit Playground.

In this lab, we'll focus on predicting the output of a function called `CircuitPlayground.setPixelColor()`. This function allows us to set the value of any given neopixel on the Circuit Playground to different colors of the rainbow like in the picture above. After we get familiar with the basics, we'll write our own programs as well.

The `CircuitPlayground.setPixelColor()` function requires four inputs called arguments. For example, to set the 1st neopixel to red, the function would look like this: `CircuitPlayground.setPixelColor(1,255,0,0);`. Note that the arguments are contained between parentheses `()` and there is a semicolon `;` at the end that indicates the statement is complete. 

The arguments are as follows:
1. the neopixel number (0 to 9)
2. the intensity of **red** to set the pixel to (0 to 255)
3. the intensity of **green** to set the pixel to (0 to 255)
4. the intensity of **blue** to set the pixel to (0 to 255)

In this case, we set the first argument to 1, and then the red argument to 255. This sets the 1st neopixel to the maximum possible red. Different colors can be created with different combinations of intensity for the red, green, and blue arguments.

### Running Code For The First Time
To run code for the first time, log in to one of the windows computers in the lab, open the Arduino IDE program, then follow the instructions on [this page](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-circuit-playground/set-up-test-arduino#blink-2921627) starting with the "Blink" section. If the code runs correctly, the red LED next to the USB port will blink slowly. (Don't worry about how this code works yet; for now, our goal is to make sure we can program successfully.) Once you've confirmed you can program your Circuit Playground, proceed to the exercises.

### Prediction Exercise 1
Consider the following code written below. Examine the code, and discuss what you think the result of the code will be with your group mates: Which neopixel(s) should turn on, and what color will it be? After that, copy the code into a new file in the Arduino IDE, save it, and run the code. Does the output match what you predicted? Write down both results and submit them with your lab report.

```
#include &lt;Adafruit_CircuitPlayground.h&gt;

void setup(){
	// code can be placed here and will run once
	CircuitPlayground.begin(); // initializes circuit playground functions
	CircuitPlayground.setPixelColor(7, 0, 255, 0);
}

void loop(){
	// code can be placed here and will be run repeatedly
}
```

### Prediction Exercise 2
Repeat the prediction exercise for the following code below.

```
#include &lt;Adafruit_CircuitPlayground.h&gt;

void setup(){
	// code can be placed here and will run once
	CircuitPlayground.begin(); // initializes circuit playground functions
}

void loop(){
	// code can be placed here and will be run repeatedly
	CircuitPlayground.setPixelColor(7, 0, 255, 0);
}
```

### Prediction Exercise 3
This exercise introduces a new function called `delay()`. This function takes one argument: a delay in milliseconds. There are 1000 milliseconds in one second. Repeat the prediction exercise for the following code below.

```
#include &lt;Adafruit_CircuitPlayground.h&gt;

void setup(){
	// code can be placed here and will run once
	CircuitPlayground.begin(); // initializes circuit playground functions
}

void loop(){
	// code can be placed here and will be run repeatedly
	CircuitPlayground.setPixelColor(7, 0, 255, 0);
	delay(1);
	CircuitPlayground.setPixelColor(7,0,0,0);
	delay(1);
}
```

### Written Exercise 1
You may have guessed that the code in prediction exercise 3 was supposed to turn the neopixel on and off, but it appeared on only. Adjust the argument in the delay function until you can see a visual blinking of the neopixel. Approximately how long does this delay need to be for you to see it? Record your answer and include your code in your lab report.

### Written Exercise 2
Write a program that turns the 0th neopixel bright purple using only values of 255. Think back to which colors you needed to mix to create purple with paints! You may find this [RGB color codes chart](https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html) helpful. Include your code in your lab report.

### Written Exercise 3
Write a program that uses the same purple color but is also half as bright. (Hint: use a value different than 255). Include your code in your lab report.

### Written Exercise 4
Write several programs and gradually decrease the intensity of the purple neopixel. At what intensity can you no longer see the color? Record your answer and include your code for the final answer in your lab report.
