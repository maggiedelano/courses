**ENGR 015 Lab 4 (Fall 2022): RoboLaser**

# Lab Overview
In this lab, you will learn how to use Servo motors to control a "RoboLaser" assembly. You will write a program that controls the position of the RoboLaser using the Joystick, and calibrate the RoboLaser so it can be used to draw a circle. A similar device that has two separate potentiometers is shown in the video below:

In the video above, one potentiometer moves the dot projected by the laser in the _x_ direction and the other moves it in the _y_ direction. We'll implement something similar using the two potentiometers attached to the Joystick.

!!! Warning
    **Do not shine the laser directly into your eyes or anyone else's!**
    
    Be careful not to shine the laser at a highly reflective surface such as a mirror, window, or glass whiteboard.

# Lab Groups
Will be shared in class.

# Pre-lab

In order to control the RoboLaser, we need to understand the coordinate frame and dimenions of the RoboLaser setup. Consider the diagram below:

![Figure [diagram]: Coordinate frame and important dimensions for the RoboLaser setup.](images/diagram.png)

Your laser will be situated at point O, pointing towards the board, which is parallel to the _x_ and _y_ axes, and perpendicular to the _z_ axis. Point C is the actual location on the board illuminated by the laser. Its 3D coordinates in the coordinate frame described above are (u,v,d).

The angle α controls the horizontal rotation of the laser, and β controls the vertical rotation. Therefore triangle OAB is a right triangle with base d, height u, hypotenuse ℓ, and angle α at vertex O. Furthermore, triangle OBC is also a right triangle with base ℓ, height v, hypotenuse r, and angle β at vertex O.

Note that although u and v depend on α and β (the servo rotation angles), d is fixed. This is the distance between the center of rotation and the board itself, which you will measure when you configure your setup in lab.

You goal will be to program the laser to drive to an arbitrary (u,v) location for a fixed d; that is the Joystick should be treated as inputs for u and v and not merely as inputs for α and β.

Note: this image has "v" positive downwards (so that xyz form a right-handed coordinate system). You can feel free to make "v" positive upwards if you prefer.

Dust off your trigonometry knowledge and answer the following questions on Moodle to complete the pre-lab:

1. What is α, in terms of u and d?
2. What is ℓ, in terms of u and d?
3. What is β, in terms of ℓ and v?
